    <h1>Zero Day</h1>

    <p><b>Zero Day</b> was the code-word that two students used to describe the assault they planned for over a year, and which they 
        finally executed on May 1st, 2001. On that warm and beautiful spring day, Andre Kriegman and Calvin Gabriel, two students of 
        Iroquois High School, walked onto to their campus with three semiautomatic weapons, a shotgun, a revolver, at least twenty 
        explosive devices and several knives. After a mere fifteen minutes, eleven students and one faculty member were dead, eighteen 
        students were wounded, and the two gunmen had taken their own lives. Due to the rapid influx of inquiries and requests for 
        information reguarding the assault at Iroquois High School, the Essex County Sheriff's Department has published this website.
