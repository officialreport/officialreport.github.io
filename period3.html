    <p><b>• 10:08:11 AM - 10:12:25 AM</b>
    <br>Kriegman and Gabriel move out of the library and head towards the cafeteria. As the two gunman walk down the hall, their attention is drawn to the 
    kitchen serving area, which joins the hall to the cafeteria. A group of 10 students are hiding in the kitchen and the serving area, out of sight from 
    the door. Both Kriegman and Gabriel throw one lit pipe bomb each into the serving area and continue on towards the Cafeteria. The pipe bombs detonate 
    while the some of the students in the serving area are trying to move into the rear of the kitchen. Lynn Knoblock, Christian Kluge, and Stanley Forster 
    all suffer burns; one of the bombs bursts completely, hitting Kluge and Forster with shrapnel. The other pipe bomb does not splinter, but the force of 
    the exploding gunpowder sends both end-caps in opposite directions at high velocity. Lynn Knoblock is hit with an end cap, and receives a broken shoulder. 
    Naomi Kleber is hiding in a thick metal storage cabinet 3 feet from the pipe bomb that bursts; she receives no serious injuries.
