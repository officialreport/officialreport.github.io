    <p><b>• 10:08:56 - 10:12:25 AM</b>
    <br>Kriegman and Gabriel move to the east cafeteria where they attempt to ignite a homemade bomb. After a first failure, they destroy a cash register with 
    second pipe bomb. Kriegman fires on a vending machine. This attracts Officer Halstrom's attention; she stops her cruiser, disembarks and tries to find the 
    source of the fire. Gabriel spots her cruiser and fires six rounds towards Officer Halstrom's position. Three of these rounds hit Officer Halstrom's cruiser. 
    Officer Halstrom returns fire through the window broken by Gabriel's fire. Kriegman and Gabriel move back into the hall, towards the library. They each fire on 
    library computers in the west wing of the library.
