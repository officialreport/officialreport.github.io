    <h1>About This Website</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Andre, I'm the owner of this website. This is a recreation of the 
      <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040826160957/http://www.officialreport.org/index.html">original Official Report website</a>, 
      made back in approximately 2002 for the movie Zero Day. It is also heavily inspired by <a href="https://officialreport.neocities.org/">
      another recreation</a>, however the Neocities recreation is unfinished and hasn't been updated in two years. As it is missing large 
      chunks of recreatable content, I wanted to make my own version.
    </p>
      
    <p>This recreation is not 100% faithful, I am taking stylistic liberties â€“ <i>however,</i> I am not changing any of the actual information included in
      the site. Everything included is taken directly from the original website, with the only exceptions being a few new photographs, two extra video and audio files each, 
      and some CSS differences. I am also coding this from the ground up, this is not based on source code from the original website or the Neocities recreation.
    </p>

    <p>This website was founded on September 2nd, 2023. The last edit to the site was made on September 3rd, and the site is currently in a finished state! 
      I may make changes to improve mobile viewing in the future.
    </p>
